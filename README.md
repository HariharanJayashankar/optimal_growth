# Optimal Growth
Python Scripts for Solving a Basic Infinite Horizon Growth Model. The method used here is the basic value function iteration.

## Scripts

The scripts in the folder "scripts" are building blocks to build a working way to solve the bellman equation. The scripts make use of the fact that we have some problems to which we know the analytical solution. Therefore, this gives us a useful way to compare our numerical results to the actual answer.

Once that is done, we should jump off and try solving a problem to which we do not have an analytical solution.
