# Optimal Growth
Python Scripts for Solving a Basic Infinite Horizon Growth Model. The method used here is the basic value function iteration.

## Folders

1. Analytic Bellman - Simple script to call onto the simple model which can be solved analytically. This is to compare different methods' accuracies as compared to the true analytic solution
2. value iter - Solves a neoclassical growth model with value function iteration.
3. pol_iter - Solves a neoclassical growth model with policy iteration
4. LQDP - Uses Linear quadratic dynamic programming to solve an agent's problem of saving under uncertainty
