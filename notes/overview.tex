\section{The Problem}

A consumer has to maximize:

\begin{align}
  U(c) = \frac{c^{1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma}
\end{align}

Subject to:
\begin{align}
  c_{t+1} + k_{t+1} = zk^{\alpha} + (1 - \delta)k \\
  \log(z_{t+1}) = \log(z_t) + \eta_{t+1}
\end{align}

\section{Solving}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Grid based method: We divide V(The value function) into subdomains - mostly into a multi dimensional grid, and approximate V with seperate function within each subdomain. This is interpolation.
  \item The grid will be the Cartesian product G_k x G_z, that is all combinations of our state and stochastic shocks (if there are no shocks, we will have a 1 dimensional vector here) 
\end{itemize}
